the python version can be found in python/
the go version in go/

this project was written to compare go and python (and mainly to learn python)


setup:
get mongodb running
get pymongo
get gomongo

create a db named 'blog'
create a collection 'admin' in db
add 'admin_pass' : 'yourpass' to the admin collection
(only python version uses this - for go see session.go)

how to anything:
connect to port 1337 tcp
the command 'help' is there for you

the python and go versions differ slightly. python works with passwords where the go version uses user levels.

dependencies: mongodb, pymongo, python 2.6, go (works with march 11 release), gomongo
